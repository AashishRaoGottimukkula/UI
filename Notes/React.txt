Notes on React.js

React:
	- Components Structure.
	- Faster and secure development.
	- updating DOM is faster.
        	- Reconsilation algorithm.
	- Single Page Application
        	- Routing Mechanism.
	- React uses virtual DOM.
	- React elements are immutable.


JSX - combination of JavaScript and XML.

Components:
	- Functional components.
	- Class components.
	- Higher order components.(used for writing reusable logic)
	- components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

Props:
	- react uses props(properties) to perform actions including user interaction.
	- For Functional components, props are passed explicitily.
	- For Class components, props are available by default.
	- Props are passed from parent component to child component.
	- props are read only. Child cannot update the prop without parent.
	- All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.


Destructuring:
	-We may have an array or object that we are working with, but we only need some of the items contained in these.
	-Destructuring makes it easy to extract only what is needed.

State:
	-State allows React components to change their output over time in response to user actions, network responses, and anything else, without violating any rule.
	- creation:
		- Redux(Redux Thunk and Redux Saga) or context API.
	- prevents Props drilling.

For class component:
	-to load, update and remove the components after working class component uses mounting, unmounting, updating stages.

Component lifecycle methods(Only for class components)
-Functional components have different set of lifecycle methods called Hooks.

Hooks:
	-Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy.
	-Hooks let you use more of React’s features without classes.

lifecycle methods:

-Mounting:
	These methods are called in the following order when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM:

	-constructor()
	-static getDerivedStateFromProps()
	-render()
	-componentDidMount()

-Updating:
	An update can be caused by changes to props or state. These methods are called in the following order when a component is being re-rendered:

	-static getDerivedStateFromProps()
	-shouldComponentUpdate()
	-render()
	-getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
	-componentDidUpdate()

-Unmounting
	This method is called when a component is being removed from the DOM:

	-componentWillUnmount()


Error handling:
	These methods are called when there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component.

	-static getDerivedStateFromError()
	-componentDidCatch()

Render:
	The render() method is the only required method in a class component.
